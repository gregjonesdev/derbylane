It currently has a large poker room, and offers the table games of blackjack, roulette, craps, three card poker, Mississippi stud, and Crisscross Poker. The casino was known previously as Tri-State Racetrack and Gaming Center before the addition of table games, and Tri-State Casino and Resort until the name was changed to reflect its Mardi Gras theme in July 2010.",
